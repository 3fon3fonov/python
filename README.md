## gplot.py - A python gnuplot interface

You can plot data from python via gnuplot with commands as simple as

```python
gplot([1, 4, 2, 3, 3.5], "w lp")
```

See [wiki/gplot.py](https://github.com/mzechmeister/python/wiki/gplot.py) for more details.

It works also with Jupyter ([gplot_demo.ipynb](https://github.com/mzechmeister/python/blob/master/gplot_demo.ipynb)).
